We are Mass Legal Hackers Legal Hackers, and we're hosting a hackathon from Oct 31, 2017 through Oct 31, 2017.

A hackathon is a gathering of thinkers, dreamers, and doers who come together, typically over a weekend, to share ideas and build solutions to the challenges set. It is basically a pop-up innovation lab, where you will meet and collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds. If you want to be part of creating something interesting that makes a difference to our justice system, this event is for you!

## Unconference.



An unconference, also called an open space conference, is a participant-driven meeting. Unconferences are gatherings that try to avoid one or more aspects of a conventional talking head conferences, such as fees, sponsored presentations, and top-down organization.The agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space. Unconferences typically feature open discussions rather than having a single speaker at the front of the room giving a talk. Participants, both knowledgeable and interested in legal technology topics, will determine what topics of interest will be discussed, who will lead the conversations and where the conversations will take place. Led by Dazza Greenwood of M.I.T. (lawyer and computer scientist), this unconference will address questions and explore areas of interest involving a wide range of legal technology application, implication and implementation conversations.

The Hackathon and Unconference will be taking place in the same location concurrently so those attending the Unconference will have the opportunity to wander and explore among and between Hackathon teams and get a first-hand view of what happens in the hackathon environment. The Unconference format is designed to encourage this exploration and experience.
